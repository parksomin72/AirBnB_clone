AirBnB Clone Project
This project aims to create an AirBnB clone with a command-line interface for managing objects related to the AirBnB application. The project involves creating classes for users, states, cities, places, etc., and implementing a file storage system for data management.

Command Interpreter
The command interpreter allows users to perform various operations on the AirBnB objects. These operations include creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting objects. The command interpreter can be used both interactively and in non-interactive mode.

How to Start the Command Interpreter
To start the command interpreter, run the console.py script.

$ ./console.py
How to Use the Command Interpreter
Once the command interpreter is started, you can use various commands to manage AirBnB objects. Use the help command to see a list of available commands and their descriptions.

(hbnb) help
Examples
Here are a few examples of how to use the command interpreter:

Creating a new user:
(hbnb) create User
Listing all available objects:
(hbnb) all
Deleting an object:
(hbnb) destroy User 1234-5678
