Airbnb Clone Project
Project Description
This project is an Airbnb clone that simulates the basic functionality
of the Airbnb platform. It includes a command-line interpreter for managing
different aspects of the application, such as creating users, managing 
listings, and handling reviews.

Command Interpreter
The command interpreter is a tool that allows users to interact with
the Airbnb clone through the command line. It supports various commands
to manage different entities in the application, such as users, states,
cities, amenities, places, and reviews.
